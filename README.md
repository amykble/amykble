## Hi, I'm Amy, a junior software developer. Welcome to my github profile 😄

🔧 I’m currently learning Python, with a plan to learn Django and other frameworks

💚 I love the vue ecosystem and static site generators, so if you'd like to work on a project with me, let me know!

🐣 You can find me on twitter [@amykble_dev](https://twitter.com/amykble_dev)
